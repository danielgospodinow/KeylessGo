# KeylessGo
### A KeylessGo-like system made with Arduino for my personal car

The idea of this project is to upgrade my car by adding an automatic unlocking system, based on RF.
The system unlocks the car if the transmitter is in range (1/2 meters) and locks it if the transmitter is out of range.
The transmitter is small and portable enough to be fit in whatever you want.
This way you don't need to grab for your original car key and press a button.
Instead, the car will automatically detect you when you are near it and it'll unlock.
And lock itself when you're gone respectively.
